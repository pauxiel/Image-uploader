- while creating the app. I wanted to use best practices. so i studied different way of creating react component. i discover creating functional component was the best option.
- This creation of this app made me understand best practise for react folder structure.
- i also made research on the need for using arrow runction when creating react component. what i discover made me limit the use of arrow function. 
- My understanding of props and state management were solidified after building this app
